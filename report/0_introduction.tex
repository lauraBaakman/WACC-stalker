% What is it
This report accompanies the project for the course Web \& Cloud Computing, that we have called \stalker. The main functionality our application \stalker is that it allows a user, the stalker, to request information on another person, the victim, on several social networks at once. Currently we support Facebook and LinkedIn, however due to the modularity of our application adding another social network should be easy. Unfortunately all social networks we tried require that a registered user log in before they allow you to search their user database.

The application also offers users the ability to view anonymous statistics on other users of the website, for example one can see from which countries the most searches originate. \\

% What are we going to discuss
In the next chapter we will discuss the technology stack and control flow of the front-end. \Cref{ch:backend} will do the same for the back-end. The last chapter, will evaluate the project.
