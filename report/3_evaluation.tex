\section{Front End}
	When we first started building the application we were not very experienced with Angular, this is clearly visible from the oldest code. Due to time constraints we could not refactor that code. 

	As mentioned earlier had we had more time we would have removed the `start stalking' button and  used multiple PUTs to update the \t{Stalker}. Some other, enhancements that we would have build, had we had more time are working AJAX spinners and better legends for the pie charts. Most importantly we would have improved the quality of the front end code. 

	Concerning Angular, we are not sure if it was the right choice. If we had to start over we would choose once again for choose for Angular, because of the experience argument. However we would like to chance to experience some of the competing frameworks before stating that Angular definitely was the right tool for this project.
